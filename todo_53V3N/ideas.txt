QUESTION:
*need new task dialog: why static?


BEFORE FRIDAY:

- ME: fix control (splitting it: propscontrol, actioncontrol, obscontrol, datacontrol) + interface class
-  actioncontrol: stores actions, a method to retrievethem AND a method to change language!

add methods: create getaction and createnewaction(private)

- MAGNUS: you will do the bar!!!!!!!!
- Kadir + Madelen: Menu should be finished and actions as well with icons!

FRIDAY:

- fix language support (with bundle), finishe the language files (with needed names: actions, ...)
- discuss observers and update functions


NEXT:


- to decide WHO are observer, how we implement it. Any repaint function (eg: when we add a new caterogy, repaint
whe JComboBox)

- set action on close (timr? kadir??)

- set action metodo in controller, cniamato quando cambia lingua: ricrea azioni usando locale settato


- taskrow: fixa la priority.. vorrei pulsanti con immagini, fix layout


- icone per resources, menu con lingua..
